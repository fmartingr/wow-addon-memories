# Manual checklist in the game

There is no e2e suite for WoW, so these checks run by hand on the Forever client (esES). Record the date, the client
build and pass or fail for each item.

| Task | Check | Steps | Expected | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The core loads | `make install WOW_DIR=".../_forever_"`, start the game, open the AddOn list, log in. | "Memories" is in the list and loads with no Lua error. | not run |
| 1 | Command list | Type `/mem`, then `/memories`. | Each prints "Memories: commands:" and the `errors` line. | not run |
| 1 | Compartment | Click the Memories entry in the addon compartment. | It prints the command list. | not run |
| 1 | Errors box, none | On a clean install, type `/mem errors`. | It prints "Memories: no saved errors." | not run |
| 1 | Errors box | Close the game. In `WTF/Account/<account>/SavedVariables/Memories.lua`, set `["errors"] = { { ["t"] = 1793560500, ["where"] = "manual", ["msg"] = "test error", ["stack"] = "line 1" } }` inside `MemoriesDB`. Start the game and type `/mem errors`. | A box opens with "manual: test error" and "line 1", all text selected; Ctrl+C copies it; Escape closes it. | not run |
| 1 | Errors survive a reload | With at least one saved error, `/reload`, then `/mem errors`. | The same errors are listed. | not run |
